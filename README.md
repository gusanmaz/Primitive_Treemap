## Very Primitive Treemap Visualisation in Processing

This code was written for one of the homeworks for Data Visualistion Course I have taken. It is written in Processing and could probably be ported to P5.js without much effort. In information visualization and computing, treemapping is a method for displaying hierarchical data using nested figures, usually rectangles. For more detailed description you could refer to [Treemap Page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping)
